# Recursive Snake Game Using JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas

In this project, we will create a classic snake game using recursion to move the snake infinitely and handle boundary reflections. The game will be implemented using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript.

## Introduction

This tutorial demonstrates how to create a snake game using JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas. We'll use recursion to animate the snake continuously and implement boundary reflections to keep the game running infinitely.

## What is Recursion?

Recursion is a fundamental programming concept where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem. It involves two main parts:
- **Base Case:** The condition under which the recursion ends.
- **Recursive Case:** The part of the function where it calls itself with modified arguments, moving towards the base case.
